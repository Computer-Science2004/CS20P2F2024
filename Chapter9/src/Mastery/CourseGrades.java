Purpose: A CourseGrades application that simulates a grade book for a class with 12 students that each have 5 test scores. The CourseGrades application should 
use a GradeBook class that has member variables "grades", which is a two-dimensional array or integers, and methods getGrades() for prompting the user
for the test grades for each student, showGrades() that displays the grades for the class, studentAvg() that has a student number parameter and then returns the
average grade for that student, and testAvg() that has a test number parameter and then returns the average grade for that test.
